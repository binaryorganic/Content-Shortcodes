Content-Shortcodes
==================

Content Shortcodes creates a custom post type to organize repeatable content that can be embedded into your site using WordPress shortcodes. Never deal with widgets for repeatable content again.

Using the plugin is incredibly straightforward. You simply create new modular content for your site under the new Shortcodes post type, and then add that content to your site’s posts and pages with a simple shortcode.

Getting Started
===============

There are a few simple steps to getting started with the plugin:
Create a new Content Shortcode: Click the new Shortcode post-type that has been created in the left-hand menu of WordPress, and then click Add New.

Add some content to your new Content Shortcode. Make sure to give it a title and assign it a category before publishing. Those will only be used to help keep you organized in the admin section and will never be displayed on the front-end of your site, but we recommend using them for quick reference later. When you’re finished, simply click Publish.

Add a Shortcode to your site: Make note of the post-id on the View all Shortcodes screen in the admin section of WordPress. Go into your post or page and add your shortcode using the following format:

[content-shortcode post_id=XX]

where “XX” equals the post-id of the content shortcode you would like to use.
